	<p>But don't get too smug. There's still plenty of horrific ways it could all fall apart. In this article, you'll learn
	about a few of our favorites. </p>
	
	<h2>Mayan Doomsday</h2>
	<p>Skeptics suggest that the Mayan calendar simply rolls to a new 5,126-year era after 2012, and doesn't actually predict a 
	life-ending apocalypse. But given that the long-dead Mayans were wrong about virtually everything else, why should we trust
	them on this?</p>
	
	<h2>Robot Takeover</h2>
	<p>Not quite as frightenig as a Vampire Takeover or Living-Dead Takeover, a robot rebellion is still a disquieting though. 
	We are already outnumbered by our technological gadgets, and even Bill Gates fears the day his Japanese robot slave turns
	him over by the ankles and asks (in a stuitable robotic voice) "Who's your daddy now?</p>
	
	<h2>Unexplained Singularity</h2>
	<p>We don't know how the universe started, so we cant be sure it won't just end, maybe today, and maybe with nothing more
	exciting than a puff or anti-matter and a slight fizzing noise.</p>
	
	<h2>Runaway Climate Change</h2>
	<p>Dismissed by some, Al Gore's prophecy of doom may still come true. If it does, we may have to contend with vicious storms, 
	widespread food shortages, and surly air condition repairman</p>
	
	<h2>Global Epidemic</h2>
	<p>Some time in the future, a lethal virus could strike. Prediction differ about the source of the disease, but candidates
	include monkeys in the African jungle, bioterrorists, birds and pigs with the flu, warriors form the future, and aliean
	 race, hospitals that use too many antibiotics, vampires, the CIA, and unwashed bruessl prorous, Whatever the sourse, it's 
	 clearly bad news.</p>
